# Nodal Analysis Matlab code


That code is written by the help of reference:
http://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/echeeve1/Ref/mna/MNA3.html

The code take the voltage sources, resistors, current sources etc with connected nodes and
give the node voltages.

This is an algorithm to make nodel analysis also called modified nodal analysis.(MNA applied to a circuit with only passive elements (resistors) and
independent current and voltage sources results in a matrix equation of the form: Ax=z)

Codes explained with comments :D
